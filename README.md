# SYN SIM

Welcome to Syn Sim! This is a VR synesthesia simulator created by Team 9 (Evie Nivera, Kaylie Capurro, Kierian Huang, Tyler Touchstone) for UNR CS.PSY484 Spring 2025.

Basic controls:
Left/Right Trigger - Select
Left Analog Stick - Move
Right Analog Stick - Look Around 
Hand Movements - Play piano 

Upon loading in, users can choose between doing a tutorial and selecting their environment. The tutorial provides steps for activating hand tracking and allows users to “practice” playing the piano with minimal stimulation. Users do not need any experience playing piano in order to use this application. The goal is not to play the piano well, rather, it is to play something that speaks to the user. The tutorial is recommended for users who are not familiar with using hand tracking. 

Opposite of the piano is a menu that allows users to return to the main menu. From here, users can select either a “light” environment or a “dark” environment. The controls here are the same as the tutorial however the piano keys will now change color when they are played. Like the tutorial, the menu opposite of the piano allows users to return to the main menu. 

Currently there are no known game-breaking bugs. However, once the black keys are played and change color, they become translucent instead of returning to black. 


Please use unity 6000.0.38f1
